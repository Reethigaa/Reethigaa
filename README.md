üìå **Project 1: [AI-Powered Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures](https://github.com/your-username/project1)**  
‚≠ê *This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision to develop a virtual mouse that enables users to control their computer cursor using hand gestures. By eliminating the need for physical hardware, this system enhances accessibility and provides a more intuitive way to interact with digital interfaces.

Using AI-based hand tracking and gesture recognition, the system captures real-time video from a webcam and detects hand movements. Key technologies like MediaPipe, OpenCV, and deep learning models are used to identify gestures corresponding to mouse actions such as:

Cursor movement ‚Äì Moving the hand in different directions
Left-click ‚Äì Pinching thumb and index finger together
Right-click ‚Äì Pinching with three fingers
Scroll ‚Äì Moving fingers up/down
Drag and Drop ‚Äì Holding a gesture for a certain duration
The model is trained to recognize various hand positions and process them efficiently to ensure smooth and accurate cursor control. The AI-driven approach enhances user experience by reducing dependency on traditional input devices, making it ideal for touchless interactions, accessibility solutions, and gaming applications.

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
TensorFlow/Keras (for AI-based gesture recognition)
PyAutoGUI (for virtual mouse control)
This AI-powered virtual mouse system offers a futuristic, touch-free computing experience, enhancing usability in various domains, including accessibility, gaming, and human-computer interaction.*

üìå **Project 2: [Machine Learning for Cardiovascular Disease Detection](https://github.com/your-username/project2)**  
‚≠ê *Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop a predictive model that can analyze patient health data and identify the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The system utilizes various ML algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks, to classify individuals based on their likelihood of having CVD. It processes key health indicators like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, BMI, and lifestyle habits to provide accurate predictions.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and performance optimization using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and efficient model that assists healthcare professionals in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases at an early stage, improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.

Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib
This ML-driven approach enhances healthcare decision-making, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for cardiovascular disease detection.*
